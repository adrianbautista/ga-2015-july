# pairing

- goal can't be moving fast, but instead it is to produce better output that both developers can understand

# themes

- object orientated design
- refactoring

# naming

- variable naming demonstrates knowledge of the "concept"
- for single responsibility, method should describe one concept
- you don't get to use techincal names in method names, use names in the domain of the customer
- name should be one level higher than implementation
- messages say what they want, not what they want you to do?
